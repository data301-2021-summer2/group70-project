## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This is a pursuit in exploring the 21,064 possible guitar chords on a standard fretboard with six strings. I will be investigating qualitative metrics for the types of guitar chords in terms of physical difficulty to play. Additionally I will be exploring the nature of navigating between chords using these metrics. In theory, there are two degrees of difficulty when playing chords. The first being the difficulty of playing the beginnning or lead chord. The latter, is the difficulty of movement from a current chord to the next chord. This difficulty should be similar to the difficulty of creating the lead chord. It would be interesting if there is a "path of least resistance" for all of the chords. What I mean by this is, there must be a way to string the easiest to play chords together to find the longest path of easy to play chords out of all of them. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This data set was created to be an exhaustive set of every possible guitar chord. It has been used to create software for guitar learning. I will be using it to explore metrics based on the difficulty of playing chords. The data set provides all necessary information to describe and even play a given chord. Some of these attributes include the chord name, the finger positions for each chord, and what notes of the given scale the chord uses.
