**EDA and Research Questions**
I decided to quantify the chordal data by administering a value of easy or hard depending on the chord type. Then I deceided a distribution plot would be the best way to visualize the easy versus hard chords. As I expected, the hard chords outnumber the easy chords significantly. When we look at the dat, this is largely due to the fact that the easier chords are based on generic root notes on a mjor scale. The guitar was literally engineered so these chords would be easier to play. It is still cool to see the visualization. It is humbling in a way to see the distribution of "hard" versus "easy" chords. I think that as I go furhter with the project I will refine these definitions to include moderate chords that are neither beginner level easy or master level hard.
