## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

This is a pursuit in exploring the 21,064 possible guitar chords on a standard fretboard with six strings. I will be investigating qualitative metrics for the types of guitar chords in terms of physical difficulty to play and how complex a given chord's structure and notes are to play. I will be exploring the nature of chord structural complexity versus its playable difficulty. To do this I have generated two metrics, complexity and difficulty. Complexity is a function of the number of a given chord's notes combined with the number of elements in its structure. Difficulty is a function of the number of fingers used to play the given chord. I predict that complex chords will also be difficult to play. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
This data set was created to be an exhaustive set of every possible guitar chord. It has been used to create software for guitar learning. I will be using it to explore metrics based on the difficulty of playing chords. The data set provides all necessary information to describe and even play a given chord. Some of these attributes include the chord name, the finger positions for each chord, and what notes of the given scale the chord uses.
